There is no Data Structure in place to speed up distance queries.
The function that returns a point adds it to the array of existing points, I assume that that counts as changing state, so i tried marking the function
as BluprintCallable. However, that meant that the function was never called so i just changed it to BlueprintPure and it worked. No idea why or how to fix that.

All of the relevant code exists inside assn3_bluenoiseBPLibrary.h/.cpp
